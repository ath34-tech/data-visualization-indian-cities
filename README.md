# Data Visualization of Rent Data in Six Indian Cities

## Project Overview

This project involves visualizing rent data across six major Indian cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. The dataset includes information on the number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen (BHK), plot size, and rent. The goal is to analyze and compare rent trends based on different parameters such as BHK and plot size, with average rent calculated for each city on a monthly basis using the `groupby` method.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `City`: Name of the city (Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore)
- `BHK`: Number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen
- `Plot Size`: Size of the plot in square feet
- `Rent`: Rent in INR

## Data Processing

The average rent for each city in each month is calculated using the `groupby` method on the dataset.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations to analyze rent trends:

1. **Rent Comparison Between Cities Based on Room Size**: Compare average rent between two cities for different room sizes.
2. **Bubble Matrix**: Visualize the relationship between BHK, plot size, and average rent for each city.

## Usage

To view and interact with the visualizations:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rent-data-visualization.git ```
